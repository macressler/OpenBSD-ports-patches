The silver searcher (also known as ag) is a fast text searching tool
similar to grep or ack. It performs faster than ack, yet is also aware
of ignore files of git and mercurial repositories and does not search
files listed in ignore files. It further utilises threads and advanced
features of PCRE to further improve performance.
