Neotoma is a packrat parser-generator for Erlang for Parsing Expression
Grammars (PEGs).  It consists of a parsing-combinator library with
memoization routines, a parser for PEGs, and a utility to generate
parsers from PEGs. It is inspired by treetop, a Ruby library with
similar aims, and parsec, the parser-combinator library for Haskell.
