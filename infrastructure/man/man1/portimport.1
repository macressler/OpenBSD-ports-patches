.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl u Ar username
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is used to import the directories and files of a new port to the
.Ox
ports
.Xr cvs 1
repository, avoiding common mistakes.
It has to be executed from within the new port's directory.
.Pp
.Nm
verifies that a minimal directory and file structure for a port is in
place and that no bogus files exist.
The import is done in two steps.
In the first step, the
.Fl n
option of the cvs command is used to only check for possible problems
without changing anything and shows the cvs path where the new port will
be imported.
In the second step, the current ports directory is imported to the
.Ox
ports cvs repository.
After the import, the new port is checked out in the respective directory
of the local ports tree.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl u Ar username
Set the username used for
.Xr ssh 1 ,
and to compose vendor and release tags.
Defaults to the local username.

modified by Stuart Henderson and rewritten by Robert Peichaer.

environment variable is not used.
