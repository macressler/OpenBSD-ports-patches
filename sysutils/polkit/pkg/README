In most situations, polkit will require a session to be marked as
"active" before granting privileges. This is done using ConsoleKit, so
you will most likely want to install the consolekit package along with
polkit.

To grant privileges interactively in a GUI, polkit will need the user to
input his password. This is done using a helper daemon (launched when
starting your X session) which needs to be installed (if not already):
    for a GTK based Desktop	-> polkit-gnome
    for a QT based Desktop	-> polkit-qt4
