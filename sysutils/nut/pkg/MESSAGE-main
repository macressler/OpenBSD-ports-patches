The userid running NUT (normally ${NUT_USER}) must have access to the relevant
device nodes. For a UPS connected by RS232, either add ${NUT_USER} to group
"dialer" or change group of the relevant /dev/tty* device to ${NUT_USER}.
For a USB-connected UPS, change the group of the relevant /dev/ugen* and
/dev/usb* devices to ${NUT_USER}; to identify the specific controller and
ugen device names, use "sudo usbdevs -vd".

Support for some network UPS devices requires additional libraries so this
has been split into subpackages: nut-snmp (for SNMP-based devices) and
nut-xml (for Eaton/MGE UPS with an XML/HTTP interface card). The nut-scan
tool is also packaged separately.
