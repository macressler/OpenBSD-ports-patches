Configuring the salt master
===========================

You need to specify the interface/hostname it will bind to in
${SYSCONFDIR}/salt/master
(see https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/5649)
By default it is set to 127.0.0.1

Configuring the salt minion(s)
==============================

In  common cases you only need to specify the hostname of the salt master
to bind to in ${SYSCONFDIR}/salt/minion

Exchanging keys
===============
Once salt-master and salt-minion are started on all sides, you need to
tell the master to accept the minion's keys. You can list the pending
keys on the master with:

$ sudo -u _salt-master salt-key -L

And accept all pending keys with:

$ sudo -u _salt-master salt-key -A

Running tests
=============

On the master, you can check that everything is running fine with:

$ sudo -u _salt-master salt '*' test.ping
$ sudo -u _salt-master salt-run cache.grains

Security concerns
=================

Note that to be able to configure things on remote hosts, the minion
runs as root. If this doesn't suit you, you can make it use another
unpriviledged users and use sudo to run priviledged commands.

Refer to http://docs.saltstack.com/contents.html for more information.
