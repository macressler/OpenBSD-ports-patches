Configuring Tomcat to support Railo
===================================
Railo is a Java-based CFML engine. It runs as a servlet in a container;
this package is designed to work with the Apache Tomcat servlet container,
you will need to make a few configuration changes to tomcat to use it.
If you have not yet modified Tomcat's configuration, this readme includes
a patch which can be used:

	# patch -d ${CATALINA_BASE}/conf < \
	    ${LOCALBASE}/share/doc/pkg-readmes/${FULLPKGNAME}

Then skip to the next section in this file, "Starting the service
and online configuration".

If you need to edit manually, Tomcat's ${CATALINA_BASE}/conf/web.xml file
should have these changes:

- Add lines after the first <?xml...?> line at the top of the file, so it
looks like this:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
<!DOCTYPE root [
    <!ENTITY railo SYSTEM "./web-railo.xml" >
]>

- Towards the bottom of web.xml, add the CFML-related file extensions
to the <welcome-file-list> section:

	<welcome-file-list>
	    <welcome-file>index.cfm</welcome-file>
	    <welcome-file>index.cfml</welcome-file>
	    <welcome-file>index.html</welcome-file>
	    <welcome-file>index.htm</welcome-file>
	    <welcome-file>index.jsp</welcome-file>
	</welcome-file-list>

- Add "&railo;" at the bottom of the </web-app> section to include the
"railo" xml entity defined above. This just includes the contents of the
web-railo.xml file containing the CF-related settings.

	&railo;
	</web-app>

Starting the service and online configuration
=============================================

- Start/restart tomcat:

	${RCDIR}/tomcat restart

- Connect to http://localhost:8080/. If all goes well you should see the
default Railo homepage including a couple of samples and links to the
admin pages.

- Connect to the admin pages and set passwords:

	http://localhost:8080/railo-context/admin/server.cfm
	http://localhost:8080/railo-context/admin/web.cfm

- You can add pages to /var/tomcat/webapps/ROOT to be used for "localhost".
Additional host configurations can be added to ${CATALINA_BASE}/conf/server.xml.
Use the localhost configuration as a template; the _tomcat user will need to be
able to write to <appBase>/ROOT/WEB-INF, so set ownership and permissions
accordingly.

- Log files are kept in several locations. Consult them if things don't work
as expected, and don't forget to rotate/archive them as appropriate.

	${CATALINA_BASE}/logs
	${CATALINA_BASE}/railo/server-config/railo-server/context/logs
	${CATALINA_BASE}/railo/web-config/*/logs (various dirs, per-context)
