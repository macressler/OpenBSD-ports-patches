VBA-M is a fork from the now inactive VisualBoy Advance project, with
goals to improve the capabilities and features of the emulator with:

Improved Save Handling

The original vba lacked support for the tiny save files created by games
like Kirby's tilt and tumble and Final Fantasy Legends.  Pokemon
Gold/Silver/Crystal RTC data is also handled more accurately.

Improved Archive Support

ROM images can now be packed with LZMA/LZMA2 7zip, which provides a much
better compression ratio for Gameboy(Advance) games.

Improved Input Capabilities

You can now map multiple buttons / devices in the input screen.

New built-in Pixel Filters

ASM versions of the HQ3x and 4x, and LQ2-4x filters for better filtering
on large screens.

KEGA Fusion Filter Plugin Support

Filters created in this format can also be used if you find one better
than the built in filters.

ARM Thumb Optimised

Several ARM Thumb optimisation patches from the original project that
were never applied to trunk are also implemented, including a fix for
the flickering in v-rally that the patch caused.

Blargg's GB_APU

This improved the sound in many games, and provided the ability to
filter out the clicking in some GBC titles.

UPS Patch support

For use with games like Mother3, whose translation patch was provided as
a UPS file.

JoyBus support

For use with Dolphin-emu, for games like Four Swords Adventures which use
the gameboy advance as a controller.
