Setting up a gopher site
========================

After installing the gophernicus package, edit /etc/inetd.conf and add
the following, all on one line:

gopher stream tcp nowait _gophernicus ${TRUEPREFIX}/sbin/in.gophernicus	in.gophernicus -h "hostname"

Replace "hostname" with the system's hostname, this should be valid
and resolvable as it is used to construct links.

By default Gophernicus serves documents from /var/gopher and will
only serve files which are world-readable; being readable by the
server process is not enough.

For more information, see ${TRUEPREFIX}/share/doc/gophernicus/README.
