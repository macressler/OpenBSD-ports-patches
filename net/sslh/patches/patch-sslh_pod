 The idea is to have B<sslh> listen to the external 443 port,
 accept the incoming connections, work out what type of
 connection it is, and then fordward to the appropriate
 server.
 
+B<sslh> comes in two versions: B<sslh-fork> forks a new process 
+for each incoming connection. It is well-tested and very
+reliable, but incurs the overhead of many processes. B<sslh-select>
+uses only one thread, which monitors all connections at once.
+It is more recent and less tested, but only incurs a 16 byte
+overhead per connection. Also, if it stops, you'll lose all
+connections, which means you can't upgrade it remotely.
