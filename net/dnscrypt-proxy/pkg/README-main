In order to perform queries over DNSCrypt, using OpenDNS as a
resolver, the easiest way is change your /etc/resolv.conf file to:

nameserver 127.0.0.1
lookup file bind
options edns0

But DNSCrypt does _not_ cache queries. So the recommended way to use
it is as a forwarder for a DNS cache like Unbound.
Both can safely run on the same host.

A list of non-OpenDNS resolvers providing DNSCrypt service is available
at http://dnscrypt.org/.
