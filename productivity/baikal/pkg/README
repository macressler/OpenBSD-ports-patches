+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Apache Configuration
====================
Baikal has been installed into ${INSTDIR}.

You should point this to the DocumentRoot of your web-server:
   # ln -s ../baikal/html /var/www/htdocs/baikal
(make sure you use a relative symlink since Apache is chrooted)

You can ensure you have a working install by accessing:
http://<hostname>/baikal/

You may want to adjust the rights of the ${INSTDIR}Specific/
folder to ensure write access for the installer.

Alternatively you can setup a virtual host using the configuration
provided in ${INSTDIR}Specific/virtualhosts/

Baikal administration
=====================
To administer Baikal the following URL needs to be accessed:
http://<hostname>/baikal/
