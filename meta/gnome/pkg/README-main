| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(see "Cheat sheet" at the end of this file for a quick setup)

The GNOME desktop is composed of 2 meta-packages:
    * gnome, for a standard GNOME installation
    * gnome-extra, for a full GNOME installation

The "gnome" package is focused on generic usage to give the user the
choice to install his favorite applications for daily usage (i.e.
accessibility, development, PIM and office type packages have been left
out on purpose).

Starting GNOME
==============
Before running gnome-session(1), a system-wide D-Bus daemon needs to be
running ("dbus_daemon" needs to be added to the "pkg_scripts" variable
in rc.conf.local(8)).

Then the following line needs to be added:
    exec ${LOCALBASE}/bin/ck-launch-session ${TRUEPREFIX}/bin/gnome-session
in ~/.xinitrc when using startx(1) (console login)
in ~/.xsession when using xdm(1) (X Display Manager login)

mDNS/DNS-SD support
===================
The avahi-daemon(8) daemon provides Zeroconf support (aka. Bonjour /
Rendezvous) in GNOME. Several applications can optionally benefit from
it (e.g. the "Network" shortcut in nautilus(1)) while some others
will not work at all without it (e.g. seahorse-sharing(1)).

To make use of it, rc.conf.local(5) needs to contain the following line:
    multicast_host=YES
and "avahi_daemon" needs to be added to the "pkg_scripts" variable
_after_ "dbus_daemon".

A note about accessibility
==========================
Dependency on a11y packages is never enforced so to activate a specific
assistive technology that is not included by default, you need to
explicitely install the corresponding package(s):
    * mousetweaks - mouse accessibility enhancements
    * orca - assistive technology for visually impaired

Note that "caribou", the input assistive technology (i.e. virtual
keyboard) is installed automatically with gnome-shell and therefore with
this "gnome" package.

Cheat sheet
===========
* /etc/rc.conf.local
	multicast_host=YES
	pkg_scripts="${pkg_scripts} dbus_daemon avahi_daemon"
* ~.xinitrc | ~.xsession
	exec ${LOCALBASE}/bin/ck-launch-session ${TRUEPREFIX}/bin/gnome-session
