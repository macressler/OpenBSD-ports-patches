| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(see "Cheat sheet" at the end of this file for a quick setup)

The GNOME desktop is composed of 2 meta-packages:
    * gnome, for a standard GNOME installation
    * gnome-extra, for a full GNOME installation

The "gnome" package is focused on generic usage to give the user the
choice to install his favorite applications for daily usage (i.e. PIM,
WWW browser, office and development applications have been left out on
purpose).

OpenGL and drm(4)
=================
GNOME requires a 3D accelerated display. By default, the drm(4) devices
are only accessible by "root" and members of the "wheel" group. Both GDM
(when used to login) and users need access to /dev/drmX which can be
done by running the following command as root (note that there may be
some security implications in doing this):
    chmod 0666 /dev/drm0

In case the machine has multiple video cards, it may be necessary to do
the same with /dev/drm{1,2,3}.

Another solution would be to create a new group (e.g. "video"), change
the group ownership of /dev/drmX accordingly and put the users and
"_gdm" into that group.

Starting GNOME
==============

DBus
----
Before running gnome-session(1), a system-wide D-Bus daemon needs to be
running ("dbus_daemon" needs to be added to the "pkg_scripts" variable
in rc.conf.local(8)).

GDM
---
It is _strongly_ advised to use GDM as the login manager otherwise some
key features like screen locking will not work properly. To do so, "gdm"
must be added at the end of "pkg_scripts" in rc.conf.local(8) (and
"xdm_flags" commented or removed).

Alternatively, to start GNOME without GDM (not recommended), the
following line needs to be added:
    exec ${LOCALBASE}/bin/ck-launch-session ${TRUEPREFIX}/bin/gnome-session
in ~/.xinitrc when using startx(1) (console login)
in ~/.xsession when using xdm(1) (xdm(1) or similar login)

mDNS/DNS-SD support
===================
The avahi-daemon(8) daemon provides Zeroconf support (aka. Bonjour /
Rendezvous) in GNOME. Several applications can optionally benefit from
it (e.g. the "Network" shortcut in nautilus(1)) while some others
will not work at all without it (e.g. seahorse-sharing(1)).

To make use of it, rc.conf.local(5) needs to contain the following line:
    multicast_host=YES
and "avahi_daemon" needs to be added to the "pkg_scripts" variable
_after_ "dbus_daemon".

Cheat sheet
===========
# echo 'chmod 0666 /dev/drm*' >> /etc/rc.local
# echo 'multicast_host=YES' >> /etc/rc.conf.local
# echo 'pkg_scripts="${pkg_scripts} dbus_daemon avahi_daemon gdm"' >> /etc/rc.conf.local
# reboot
