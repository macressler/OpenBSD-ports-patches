| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(see "Cheat sheet" at the end of this file for a quick setup)

The GNOME desktop is composed of 2 meta-packages:
    * gnome, for a standard GNOME installation
    * gnome-extra, for a full GNOME installation

The "gnome" package is focused on generic usage to give the user the
choice to install his favorite applications for daily usage (i.e. PIM,
WWW browser, office and development applications have been left out on
purpose).

Starting GNOME
==============

DBus
----
Before running gnome-session(1), a system-wide D-Bus daemon needs to be
running ("dbus_daemon" needs to be added to the "pkg_scripts" variable
in rc.conf.local(8)).

GDM
---
It is _strongly_ advised to use GDM as the login manager otherwise some
key features like screen locking will not work properly. To do so, "gdm"
must be added at the end of "pkg_scripts" in rc.conf.local(8) (and
"xdm_flags" commented or removed).

Changing the GDM greeter language is done in:
    ${SYSCONFDIR}/gdm/locale.conf

*** NOT RECOMMENDED ***
Alternative (non-GDM) GNOME startup
-----------------------------------
To start GNOME without GDM, the following line needs to be added:
    exec ${LOCALBASE}/bin/ck-launch-session ${TRUEPREFIX}/bin/gnome-session
to ~/.xinitrc when using startx(1) (console login)
to ~/.xsession when using xdm(1) (xdm(1) or similar login)

mDNS/DNS-SD support
===================
The avahi-daemon(8) daemon provides Zeroconf support (aka. Bonjour /
Rendezvous) in GNOME. Several applications can optionally benefit from
it (e.g. the "Network" shortcut in nautilus(1)) while some others
will not work at all without it (e.g. seahorse-sharing(1)).

To make use of it, rc.conf.local(5) needs to contain the following line:
    multicast_host=YES
and "avahi_daemon" needs to be added to the "pkg_scripts" variable
_after_ "dbus_daemon".

Cheat sheet
===========
# echo 'multicast_host=YES' >>/etc/rc.conf.local
# echo 'pkg_scripts="${pkg_scripts} dbus_daemon avahi_daemon gdm"' >>/etc/rc.conf.local
# reboot
