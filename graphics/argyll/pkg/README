Note for users of the ColorVision Spyder2
=========================================
(taken from Debian package: argyll-1.1.1-2)

The Spyder2 device doesn't work "out of the box" because it needs a
firmware to be loaded into it.  That firmware is proprietary and cannot
be distributed, but Argyll provides a tool to extract that firmware from
the driver CD provided with the device.

If you're only using your Spyder2 on one computer, then all you need to
do is run the "spyd2en" utility (as root) while the driver CD is
mounted.  spyd2en looks for the CD in a few typical mount points
(/media/ColorVision, /mnt/cdrom, /media/cdrom, /cdrom).  If your CD is
mounted somewhere else, just run spyd2en from that mount point.  In both
cases, the firmware will be extracted and stored into
/var/db/argyll/spyd2PLD.bin, where the other utilities will be able to
look for it when needed.
