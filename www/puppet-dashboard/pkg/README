The Puppet Dashboard has been installed into ${INSTDIR}

To configure your database you must first edit config/database.yaml
and then run the following command from ${INSTDIR}:

	$ rake install

After that you can start your server by calling:

	$ script/server

This will start a Rails server on port 3000. For more information on
Puppet Dashboard, please refer to ${INSTDIR}/README.markdown
