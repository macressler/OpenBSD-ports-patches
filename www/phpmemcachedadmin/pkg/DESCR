This program allows to see in real-time (top-like) or from the start of
the server, stats for get, set, delete, increment, decrement, evictions,
reclaimed, cas command, as well as server stats (network, items, server
version) with googlecharts and server internal configuration. You can go
further to see each server slabs, occupation, memory wasted and items (key
& value). Another part can execute commands on any memcached server: get,
set, delete, flush_all, as well as execute any commands (like stats) with
telnet.
