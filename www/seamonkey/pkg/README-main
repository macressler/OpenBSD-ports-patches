| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

To disable anti-aliasing (xft) set GDK_USE_XFT=0 in the environment.

Plugins
=======
Seamonkey looks for plugins in ~/.mozilla/plugins and
${LOCALBASE}/lib/mozilla/plugins.
If the environment variable MOZ_PLUGIN_PATH is specified, this
location will be overridden.

Internationalization
====================
This package contains internationalizations for all supported
languages.  To configure Seamonkey for your language, go to
Edit->Preferences->Appearance->Languages/Content and select your
favorite Language/Content pack.

Debugging
=========
If you encounter crashes, you might want to build the debug FLAVOR of
this package, and run seamonkey inside gdb, so that you can gather
debugging logs and traces (for all threads !).
Bug reports without that information will be ignored.
