PhotoShow is a very easy to use web gallery installable on any web
server.

Some highlights:
Easy to use	Adding and sorting photos, albums, users, and groups
		have never been easier. Simply drag and drop them
		wherever you want. To delete a photo or an album, just
		drag and drop it on the bin.
Fully Generated	PhotoShow automatically generates the whole website,
		including the thumbnails. Also, if your photos are
		bigger than 800x600px, it generates a smaller version
		for displaying (the big version is still available for
		your viewers to download, of course).
FS Powered	The architecture of PhotoShow's albums is created using
		the File System directly: no database is required to use
		PhotoShow. You can use your File System directly to add,
		move, or delete albums and pictures.
Users/Groups	Each of your files and folders has its owns permissions,
		configurable in PhotoShow by the Admin. On the go,
		select which group/user can access an item.
