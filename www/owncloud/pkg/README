| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

ownCloud is installed under
    ${INSTDIR}

Post-installation instructions
==============================
With Apache, AllowOverride settings are required on the ${INSTDIR}
directory. You can configure this as follows:
    # ln -sf ${PREFIX}/conf/modules.sample/owncloud.conf ${PREFIX}/conf/modules

"allow_url_fopen" needs to be enabled in PHP using _one_ of the
following methods:
    1. ${SYSCONFDIR}/php-{MODPHP_VERSION}.ini
    allow_url_fopen = On
    2. /var/www/conf/httpd.conf (main server or VirtualHost)
    php_admin_value allow_url_fopen 1

The maximum upload size for files can be modified in
    ${INSTDIR}/.htaccess

When not using Apache, make _sure_ to set the data directory to a
location outside of the document root.

To finish the installation, point you browser to:
    http://<hostname>/owncloud/

Database Configuration
----------------------
ownCloud can work with a PostgreSQL, MySQL or SQLite3 database.
Support for SQLite3 is included with the main php package; to use
another database, the corresponding package needs to be installed:
    php-pdo_pgsql or php-pdo_mysql

When using SQLite, not further configuration is required. However, with
MySQL or PostgreSQL, the file ${INSTADIR}/config/config.sample.php will
need to be copied to ${INSTADIR}/config/config.php and configured
accordingly.

LDAP User Backend
-----------------
If the LDAP user backend is enabled, the "php-ldap" package will need to
be installed.

Finishing and validating the installation
-----------------------------------------
Accessing http://<hostname>/owncloud with a Web browser will finish the
installation and create a new admin user.

WebDAV access
=============
The personnal WebDAV share can be accessed using the following URL (e.g.
with Nautilus, Thunar or Doplhin) and the corresponding user and
password for the share:
    http://<hostname>/files/webdav.php

NOTE that it is highly recommended to use SSL on the webserver so that
access is done over https instead of http.

Synchronization
===============
The "csync" package (net/csync) can be installed to synchronize local
files with ownCloud. e.g.
    $ csync /path/to/localdir ownclouds://<username>:<password>@<hostname>/files/webdav.php/remotedir/
