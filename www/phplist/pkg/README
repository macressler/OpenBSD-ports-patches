When upgrading from a previous version, please follow these instructions:

  1. keep your config.php file somewhere safe (you can find your
     config.php file in the config folder)

  2. make a backup of your database. (recommended, but not essential)

  3. overwrite your existing code with the new code. You will primarily
     want to copy the "lists" folder and all files in it.

  4. copy the config.php file back (to the "lists/config/" folder)

  5. go to your phpList admin main page with your web browser and login

  6. click the "Upgrade" link, which will now be there.

  7. the upgrade has now been performed.
