nginx [engine x] is an HTTP and mail proxy server.

This is the stable branch of nginx, as distributed by nginx.org.  It
provides additional compiled-in modules over the version in the base system.

Because the base system includes nginx, the ${RCDIR}/nginx script is
tailored to that version.  Therefore to manipulate this port's processes, you
should instead use the ${RCDIR}/enginx script.

Documentation for nginx can be found on the wiki:
    http://wiki.nginx.org/

Each of the available FLAVORs has more documentation available at their 
respective homepages:
