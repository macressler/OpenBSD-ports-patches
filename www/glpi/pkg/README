| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The GLPI Asset Management Software has been installed into
${INSTDIR}

You should point this to the DocumentRoot of your web-server:
   # ln -s ../glpi /var/www/htdocs/glpi
(make sure you use a relative symlink since Apache is chrooted)

and proceed to complete the installation by reading:
http://www.glpi-project.org/spip.php?rubrique27

You can ensure you have a working install by accessing:
http://<localhost>/glpi/
