NSH consolidates configuration for interfaces, bridging, routing, PF
packet filtering, NAT, queueing, BGP, OSPF, RIP, IPsec, DHCP, DVMRP,
SNMP, relayd, sshd, inetd, ftp-proxy, resolv.conf and NTP. It presents
the user with a vaguely cisco-like interface with all configuration in
one easy to read text list.
