By default, the _dovecot user, and so the Dovecot processes run in
the login(1) class of "daemon". On a busy server, it may be advisable
to put the _dovecot user and processes in their own login(1) class
with tuned resources, such as more open file descriptors etc.

For example, add this to the login.conf(5) file:

       dovecot:\
                :openfiles-cur=512:\
                :openfiles-max=2048:\
                :tc=daemon:

Rebuild the login.conf.db file if necessary:

	# [ -f /etc/login.conf.db ] && cap_mkdb /etc/login.conf

For larger servers these numbers and memory limits (e.g. datasize
and stacksize) may also need to be increased. In particular, indexing
emails for full-text search is likely to need an increased datasize.
Please report any changes and experiences to the package maintainers
so that we can update this file for future versions.
