+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Post-installation steps
=======================
Register the mimedefang milter with sendmail(8) by adding the following
to your .mc file:

    INPUT_MAIL_FILTER(`mimedefang', \
        `S=local:/var/spool/MIMEDefang/mimedefang.sock, \
        F=T, T=C:15m;S:4m;R:4m;E:10m')dnl

Then re-generate your .cf file.

When using administrator notifications, it is advised to add the
"_mdefang" user to the list of users that are allowed to set their
envelope "from" address to a different user. This is done in:
    /etc/mail/trusted-user

IP validation header
====================
To retain relay's IP address information between Mail eXchangers, an
identical ${SYSCONFDIR}/mail/mimedefang-ip-key must be installed on all
relays. The content of this file is generated using:
    # ${PREFIX}/share/examples/gen-ip-validator.pl

Start-up order
==============
Be sure to start mimedefang_multiplexor before mimedefang_daemon in
rc.local(8).
