Soprano (formally known as QRDF) is a library which provides a nice Qt
interface to RDF storage solutions. It has a modular structure which 
allows to  replace the actual RDF storage implementation used. 

* Full context (i.e. named graph) support
* Plugin structure for extensibility
* Server and client lib which allows a simple remote Soprano server
* Simple sopranod server application
* Simple sopranocmd tool to perform commands on models in a Soprano server
* Rule-based Forward inference engine
* Full-text index based on CLucene which indexes all literal 
  statements (i.e. those statements with a literal object node)
* Hierarchical architecture which allows to stack multiple filter models
  on top of an RDF storage
