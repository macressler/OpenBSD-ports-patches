SQLite database of every port in the system. This can be queried through
e.g., sqlitebrowser, or any kind of programming interface.

This is more suitable for human consumption, use sqlite-compact for
more structured information.

Database Schema:

holds all the information retrieved through various variables, e.g.,:
    AUTOCONF_VERSION

    README

This information is mostly unchanged, except for replacing Yes/No variables
with 1/0. Variables not present in a given port are left undefined.

README corresponds to README files (full text value) and only exists when
such files are present.

Note that USE_LIBTOOL is 3-valued: 2 is gnu, 1 is yes, undef is no.

The FULLPKGPATH is complete, including flavor and pseudo-flavors markers.
For every port with MULTI_PACKAGES settings, one entry is written for 
each SUBPACKAGE.

- Paths (FULLPKGPATH, PKGPATH, CANONICAL)
PKGPATH is the stripped down version or FULLPKGPATH, without flavors 
or subpackage markers.
CANONICAL points to the reduced version.

- Flavors(FULLPKGPATH, VALUE)
- Categories(FULLPKGPATH, VALUE)
- Multi(FULLPKGPATH, VALUE, SUBPKGPATH)
- Modules(FULLPKGPATH, VALUE)
- Configure(FULLPKGPATH, VALUE)
- ConfigureArgs(FULLPKGPATH, VALUE)
- NotForArch(FULLPKGPATH, VALUE)
- OnlyForArch(FULLPKGPATH, VALUE)
- Targets(FULLPKGPATH, VALUE)
All of these variable values are actually lists. These lists are taken apart
and result in many entries in these secondary tables (or none if the list
is completely empty)

- Depends(FULLPKGPATH, FULLDEPENDS, PKGSPEC, REST, DEPENDSPATH, TYPE)
All depends are stored in a single table, including the type:
R -> run
L -> lib
B -> build
T -> test
with FULLDEPENDS the full text of the dependency, DEPENDSPATH the PKGPATH
we depend upon, PKGSPEC the spec we depend upon (if explicit), and REST
the rest.
- Wantlib(FULLPKGPATH, VALUE)
All the libraries the FULLPKGPATH depends upon, with and without version number,
coming from either the WANTLIB variable or various LIB_DEPENDS.

- Multi(FULLPKGPATH, VALUE, SUBPKGPATH)
with SUBPKGPATH the normalized pkgpath for that subpackage.

- BROKEN(FULLPKGPATH, ARCH, VALUE)
All the broken entries, which might be arch-dependent.

- Shared_Libs(FULLPKGPATH, LIBNAME, VERSION)
