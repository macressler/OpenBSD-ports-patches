To play the game you will need an original Doom, Ultimate Doom, Doom II
or Final Doom IWAD. Place the doom.wad, doom2.wad, plutonia.wad,
tnt.wad, or all of the above in ${PREFIX}/share/doom/ to play.

If multiple IWADs are installed, you may specify the one you want to
play via the -iwad command-line parameter e.g.

  $ chocolate-doom -iwad doom.wad

The Shareware IWAD is available in the doomdata package.

Run `chocolate-setup' to generate a configuration file to your liking.
