Broken Bar-Complete
===================

The default bar-completion binding does not appear to work on OpenBSD.
This has been reported upstream: https://github.com/diml/utop/issues/19

In the meantime you can bind bar-complete to something else, for example
ALT+down. Put the following in your ~/.lambda-term-rc:

---8<---
[read-line]
M-down: complete-bar
---8<---
