To be able to display popup notifications one of the following
notification daemons needs to be installed:

    * notification-daemon
    * xfce4-notifyd
    * notification-daemon-xfce (deprecated)

Note that gnome-shell also acts as a notification daemon in which case
it is not necessary to install another one.
