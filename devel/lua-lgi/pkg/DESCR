LGI is gobject-introspection based dynamic Lua binding to GObject based
libraries. It allows using GObject-based libraries directly from Lua.

If you see errors like "undefined symbol 'pthread_mutex_unlock'", you
will need to manually load the pthread shared library; you can do this
by setting "LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libpthread.so" in the environment.
