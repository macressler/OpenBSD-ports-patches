Print Preview
=============

By default, GTK+ uses the "evince" command from the evince package to
display a "Print Preview". This can be modified by editing:
    ~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini
and appending the following line:
gtk-print-preview-command = epdfview %f

(epdfview can be replaced by any other PDF viewer command like xpdf...)

Note that by default, "evince" will remove the temporary PDF preview
file (/tmp/previewXXXXX.pdf) which might not be the case with other PDF
viewers.
