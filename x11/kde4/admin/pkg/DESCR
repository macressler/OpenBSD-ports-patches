The kdeadmin package contains packages that usually only a system
administrator might need:

* kcron
    Editor for the cron command scheduler.

* kuser
    System users/groups account manager.

* ksystemlog
    System log files monitoring and analyze tool.

* system-config-printer-kde
    KDE GUI for system-config-printer service.

Most of this stuff will be useless/non-working on OpenBSD, actually.
