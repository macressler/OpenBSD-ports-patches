Enhancing printing output
=========================
Color printers needs color profile files to get better results.  These
files are provided by your printer manufacturer and you have to install
them manually.  To do that, download the linux official drivers and
copy the "cms" directory under:
    ${TRUEPREFIX}/share/cups/model/<manufacturer>/
where <manufacturer> is either samsung, xerox or dell.

Samsung color profile files are available at
