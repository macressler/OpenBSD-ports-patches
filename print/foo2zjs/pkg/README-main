| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Before using foo2zjs you may need to get some extra files from the web:
ICM profiles (for color correction) and firmware using the command
    ${TRUEPREFIX}/share/doc/foo2zjs/getweb

Then copy the downloaded file(s) into the corresponding directory under
    ${TRUEPREFIX}/share/foo2*

If your printer require a firmware load, run the following command as
root each time the device is powered up:
    cat ${TRUEPREFIX}/share/foo2zjs/firmware/XXX.dl > /dev/ugenN.EE
-> XXX is your printer firmware name
-> /dev/ugenN.EE is the ugen(4) device (N) and endpoint (EE) of your
   printer (which can be found using `sudo usbdevs -vd`)
Alternatively, hotplugd(8) attach/detach scripts can automate this.
